
- Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). 

- It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.

Understanding the problem without Maven
---------------------------------------

There are many problems that are faced by developers and testers during the project development. They are discussed below:

1) Adding set of Jars in each project: In case of struts, spring, hibernate frameworks, we need to add set of jar files in each project. It must include all the dependencies of jars also.

2) Creating the right project structure: We must create the right project structure in servlet, struts etc, otherwise it will not be executed.

3) Building and Deploying the project: We must have to build and deploy the project so that it may work.

What it does?
-------------

Maven simplifies the above mentioned problems. It does mainly following tasks.

    It makes a project easy to build
    It provides uniform build process (maven project can be shared by all the maven projects)
    It provides project information (log document, cross referenced sources, mailing list, dependency list, unit test reports etc.)
    It is easy to migrate for new features of Maven

Apache Maven helps to manage

    Builds
    Documentation
    Reporing
    SCMs
    Releases
    Distribution

Difference between ant and maven
---------------------------------

- Ant and Maven both are build tools provided by Apache. The main purpose of these technologies is to ease the build process of a project.

- There are many differences between ant and maven that are given below:


Ant
----
	
- Ant doesn't has formal conventions, so we need to provide information of the project structure in build.xml file.	

- Ant is procedural, you need to provide information about what to do and when to do through code. You need to provide order.	

- There is no life cycle in Ant.	

- It is a tool box.	

- It is mainly a build tool.	

- The ant scripts are not reusable.
	
- It is less preferred than Maven.	


Maven
-----

- Maven has a convention to place source code, compiled code etc. So we don't need to provide information about the project structure in pom.xml file.

- Maven is declarative, everything you define in the pom.xml file.

- There is life cycle in Maven.

- It is a framework.

- It is mainly a project management tool.

- The maven plugins are reusable.

- It is more preferred than Ant.
